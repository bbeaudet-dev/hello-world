# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

Hey everyone, my name is Ben. I've been a mechanical engineer for about 5 years out of college, but now I'd really like to learn how to code and become a great software engineer. I honestly have no idea how to navigate GitHub effectively, and if I'm going to have any kind of portfolio and also know how to read/edit/write code, learning GitHub seems like a good first step. I'll also be working my way through Eloquent Javascript, Full Stack Open, Harvard's CS50, and Leetcode exercises - and I hope you follow along with me on this journey!
