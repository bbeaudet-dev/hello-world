# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

My name is Ben. I'd really like to learn how to code and become a great engineer. GitHub is very cool but I honestly have no idea how to navigate it effectively - so, if I'm going to have any kind of portfolio and also know how to read/edit/write code, learning GitHub is a good first step.
